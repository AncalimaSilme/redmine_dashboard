### Translate

You can help even without coding by translating Redmine Dashboard or improving an existing localization. I prefer translations via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/organization/redmine_dashboard/dashboard/redmine-dashboard) but also gladly accept Pull Requests for the YAML files.

### Features

You can also add a new or requested feature by sending a Pull Request. Please add specs so that I do not break your feature in the future.

There are several rake and make tasks to setup a working development environment and run all specs. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) of more information.
