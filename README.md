The dashboard columns are the different issue statuses. Closed statuses are grouped together in the "Done" column. A dialog where the done status can be selected will be shown when dropping an issue on the done column.

The dashboard supports filters to show only a subset of all project issues:

- Version
- Tracker
- All or mine tickets

Issues can be grouped in rows by:

- Tracker
- Priority
- Assignee
- Category
- Version

Filters are saved per project, so you always have your preferred settings when changing a project.

Dashboard contains two different view modes: card view and list view. Both show issue id, tracker, title, done ratio. Card view also shows assignee and version.

**Colors**

- Issue priority is indicated by color of left border.
- Overdue issues are red outlined.

**Options**

- Change assignee to current user when an issue is moved.
- Hide closed issue and resize done column.
